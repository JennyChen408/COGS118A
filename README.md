# COGS 118A Final Project – Classifier Comparison
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook used for the COGS 118A final project *“Comparing Traditional Machine Learning Classifiers on Biomedical Data: Effects of Dataset Structure and Train–Test Splits.”*

👉 Please open: **cogs118a_final_project.ipynb**

The notebook includes:
- Loading and preprocessing the four UCI biomedical datasets  
- Hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression, SVM (RBF), Random Forest, KNN, and Naive Bayes  
- Training and evaluation under three train–test splits (20/80, 50/50, 80/20)  
- Generation of the figures and tables reported in the project report  
- Friedman test for statistical comparison of classifiers  

UCI datasets are **not** included in this repository. Please download them separately from the UCI Machine Learning Repository before running the notebook.

For detailed analysis and discussion of the results, see the project report PDF submitted on Gradescope.

## Use of AI-assisted tools

ChatGPT was used to help with:
- Clarifying machine learning concepts and statistical tests (e.g., the Friedman test)
- Suggesting wording for parts of the project report and README
- Giving high-level feedback on the structure of figures and tables

All coding decisions, dataset choices, and final implementations in the notebook were made and verified by the author.
